# Upvote and Downvote Slider 

It was forked over and edited to fit the needs of the Smoke.io community.
Its for the people who do not have 50,000 SP and are not able to get the slider.
Its a HTML script that you need to edit and run on your browser to use.
Copy the link that you want to vote for and paste it in. Slide it up or down for
how ever much you want to vote.
